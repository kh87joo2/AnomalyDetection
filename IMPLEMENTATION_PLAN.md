### Open Questions
- [ ] Q01: Todo (Phase 2 Execution Plan - Training Pipeline Dashboard) [2026-02-22] (impacts: Architecture; source: `todo.md`)

### Loop Rules
- Setup mode changes planning artifacts (`AGENTS.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `specs/generated/*.md`, `PROMPT_plan.md`, `PROMPT_build.md`, `loop.sh`, `.ralph-loop/*.py`).
- Build mode executes exactly one `[ ]` task per cycle.
- Keep source docs (`prd.md`, `trd.md`, `todo.md`, `docs/*`, `README.md`) read-only during setup.
